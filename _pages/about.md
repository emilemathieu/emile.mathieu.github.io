I am now a  Machine Learning Research Scientist at [Xaira Therapeutics](https://xaira.com), based in the London office, working with [Joseph Watson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LZqtHXoAAAAJ&hl=en), [Tor  Fjelde](https://retiredparkingguard.com/about.html), [Francisco Vargas](https://mlatcl.github.io/people/francisco-vargas.html) and [Justin Barton](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rqbk7ezKqosC&hl=en). We are developing and training generative models for antibody design.

Before that I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Cambridge Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, part of the Prosperity grant led by [Prof Richard Turner](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/Turner){:target="_blank"} and [Prof José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org), and in partnership with Microsoft Research.

Previously I was an EPSRC Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Oxford affiliated with the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}, and part of the [Oxford Statistical Machine Learning Group](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/learning/){:target="_blank"}, working with [Pr Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/){:target="_blank"} and [Pr Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/index.html){:target="_blank"}.
Previous to that, I was a DPhil candidate in the same research group, supervised by [Pr Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/index.html){:target="_blank"} an [Ryota Tomioka](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ryoto/){:target="_blank"} from Microsoft Research.
Prior to that, I was a graduate enrolled in the [Mathematiques, Vision, Learning (MVA) master at Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](http://math.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/){:target="_blank"}, with an emphasis on machine learning.
<!-- Prior to that, I worked for Criteo as a data scientist intern, where I improved predictive bidding models. -->
I previously studied at [Ecole des Ponts ParisTech in the mathematics and computer science department](http://www.enpc.fr/ingenierie-mathematique-et-informatique/){:target="_blank"}.
<!-- , where I spent two years. -->

<!-- I am supported by the European Research Council under the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007–2013) / ERC grant agreement no. 617071, and by Microsoft Research through its PhD Scholarship Programme.  -->

Interests
======
My research interests centre around `Generative AI' for the Natural Sciences, with a focus on encoding problem symmetries and geometrical constraints.
I am particularly interested in molecular science and weather science.
<!-- with a focus on encoding problem symmetries and geometrical constraints, with application to the natural sciences, in particular to molecular science and weather science. -->
<!-- I am most interested in developing probabilistic machine learning models and incorporating inductive biases such as geometry and symmetry. -->
<!-- My research interests are at the interface of probabilistic machine learning and geometry. -->
<!-- Recently I have been exploring the use of machine learning for physical science, and consequently the concepts of symmetry/invariance. -->

In our recent work [Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10605), we introduced a model which admits the parametrization of flexible probability measures on smooth manifolds by defining flows as the solution to ordinary differential equations. -->

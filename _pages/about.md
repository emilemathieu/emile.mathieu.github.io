I'm an EPSRC Postdoctoral Research Associates at the University of Oxford affiliated with the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/), and part of the [Oxford Statistical Machine Learning Group](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/learning/), working with [Pr Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) and [Pr Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/index.html).

My research interests centres around deep probabilistic machine learning, geometry and invariance.
<!-- I am most interesting in developing probabilistic machine learning models and incorporating inductive biases such as geometry and symmetry. -->
<!-- My research interests are at the interface of probabilistic machine learning and geometry. -->
<!-- Recently I have been exploring the use of machine learning for physical science, and consequently the concepts of symmetry/invariance. -->

Previously, I was a DPhil candidate in the same research group, supervised by [Pr Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/index.html) an [Ryota Tomioka](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ryoto/) from Microsoft Research.
Prior to that, I was a graduate enrolled in the [Mathematiques, Vision, Learning (MVA) master at Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](http://math.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/), with an emphasis on machine learning.
<!-- Prior to that, I worked for Criteo as a data scientist intern, where I improved predictive bidding models. -->
I previously studied at [Ecole des Ponts ParisTech in the mathematics and computer science department](http://www.enpc.fr/ingenierie-mathematique-et-informatique/).
<!-- , where I spent two years. -->

<!-- I am supported by the European Research Council under the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007–2013) / ERC grant agreement no. 617071, and by Microsoft Research through its PhD Scholarship Programme.  -->

News
======
- Sept 2021. Thesis submitted! Other great news, our work with Adam Foster [On Contrastive Representations of Stochastic Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10052) has been accepted at NeurIPS 2021.
- August 2021. Starting a new postdoctoral position in the same great [OxCSML](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/learning/) research group, under the advisory of [Pr Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/).
- Dec 2020. I’m co-organizing the first [Differential Geometry meets Deep Learning](https://sites.google.com/view/diffgeo4dl/) workshop, and we have our paper [Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10605) accepted at the [Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2020](https://neurips.cc).
- July 2020. I passed my confirmation of status (last step before the PhD submission).
- Sept 2019. I'm starting an internship at FAIR New York with Max Nickel :)

In our recent work [Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10605), we introduced a model which admits the parametrization of flexible probability measures on smooth manifolds by defining flows as the solution to ordinary differential equations. -->

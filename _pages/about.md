I'm a final year DPhil student at the University of Oxford, in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/), part of the [Oxford Statistical Machine Learning Group](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/learning/), supervised by [Pr Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/index.html), and a member of Mansfield college. Previously, I was a graduate enrolled in the [Mathematiques, Vision, Learning (MVA) master at Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](http://math.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/), with an emphasis on machine learning. Prior to that, I worked for Criteo as a data scientist intern, where I improved predictive bidding models. I previously studied at [Ecole des Ponts ParisTech in the mathematics and computer science department](http://www.enpc.fr/ingenierie-mathematique-et-informatique/), where I spent two years.

My research interests are at the interface of probabilistic machine learning and geometry. More recently I have been exploring the ud of machine learning for physical science.

I am supported by the European Research Council under the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007–2013) / ERC grant agreement no. 617071, and by Microsoft Research through its PhD Scholarship Programme.

- Dec 2020. I’m co-organizing the first [Differential Geometry meets Deep Learning](https://sites.google.com/view/diffgeo4dl/) workshop, and we have our paper [Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10605) accepted at the [Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2020](https://neurips.cc).
